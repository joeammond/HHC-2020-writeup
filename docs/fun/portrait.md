At the back of the **Entry Hall** is a portrait of Santa:

Looking closely we can see it in more detail:

And zooming in, there are some letters hidden in the portrait:

Some of them are a bit tricky to find, but if you're patient enough,
you will find the phrase `NOW I SHALL BE OUT OF SIGHT`, a line from a
[poem](https://www.bartleby.com/400/poem/880.html) by [Hannah Flagg
Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Flagg_Gould) titled [*Jack
Frost*](https://internetpoem.com/hannah-f-gould/jack-frost-poem/):

> The Frost looked forth one still, clear night,<br>
> And whispered, “Now I shall be out of sight;<br>
> So, through the valley, and over the height,<br>
> In silence I'll take my way.<br>
> I will not go on like that blustering train,<br>
> The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,<br>
> That make such a bustle and noise in vain,<br>
> But I'll be as busy as they!”<br>
> <br>
> So he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest;<br>
> He lit on the trees, and their boughs he drest<br>
> With diamonds and pearls; and over the breast<br>
> Of the quivering lake he spread<br>
> A coat of mail, that it need not fear<br>
> The downward point of many a spear<br>
> That he hung on its margin, far and near,<br>
> Where a rock could rear its head.<br>
> <br>
> He went to the windows of those who slept,<br>
> And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;<br>
> Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,<br>
> By the light of the morn were seen<br>
> Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;<br>
> There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees;<br>
> There were cities with temples and towers; and these<br>
> All pictured in silvery sheen!<br>
> <br>
> But he did one thing that was hardly fair-<br>
> He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there<br>
> That all had forgotten for him to prepare-<br>
> “Now, just to set them a-thinking,<br>
> <br>
> I'll bite this basket of fruit,” said he,<br>
> “This costly pitcher I'll burst in three;<br>
> And the glass of water they've left for me<br>
> Shall 'tchick' to tell them I'm drinking!”<br>

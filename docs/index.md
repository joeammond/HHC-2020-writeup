# pugpug's 2020 Holiday Hack writeups

## Intro
One bright spot in 2020 was the annual Holiday Hack Challenge put on
by SANS. This year Santa opened his newly renovated castle to the
world. However, all was not merry and bright at the North Pole, as
nefarious powers are working against Santa and his elves. Our job in
the challenge is to solve the mystery of who is behind the problems the
elves are experiencing and bring them to justice. As we progress through
the castle we'll investigate such topics as why public S3 Amazon buckets
aren't a good idea, dig into CAN-BUS traffic, discover why "pseudo-random
number generators" aren't truly random, and why one shouldn't use MD5 as
a hash algorithm.

## Organization
This writeup covers all of the objectives (yes, even 11b!), but not
necessarily all of the elf terminals or other non-objective challenges. I'll
include any sample code I used to complete the objectives in a separate
section.

    [operating the elevator](./objectives/4.md), opening a
    [locked door](./objectives/5.md), fixing [Santa's sleigh](./objectives/7.md),
    and [bypassing a fingerprint sensor](./objectives/9.md)

Another Holiday Hack Challenge is complete. Thank you to the entire team
who puts this on. I wish I could have covered everything in this report, but as we're
limited to 50 pages, I can't. The poem hidden in the painting of Santa, evan's "Secret
Garden", the references to last years's HHC, you'll have to find on your own.

I still haven't figured out how to get to the `steamtunnels`, but I will..
